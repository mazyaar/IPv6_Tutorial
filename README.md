# IPv6 Tutorial:
IPv6, or Internet Protocol version 6, is the most recent iteration of the Internet Protocol (IP) designed to address the limitations of its predecessor, IPv4. Introduced to support the ever-expanding number of devices connected to the internet, IPv6 provides a vastly larger address space, utilizing 128-bit addresses compared to IPv4's 32-bit system. This expansion allows for approximately 3.4Ã—10^38 unique IP addresses, effectively eliminating the risk of address exhaustion that IPv4 faces. Additionally, IPv6 introduces improvements in routing and network autoconfiguration, enhances security with mandatory IPsec implementation, and simplifies packet processing. These advancements make IPv6 crucial for the continued growth and reliability of the internet, accommodating emerging technologies and the increasing demand for IP addresses.
